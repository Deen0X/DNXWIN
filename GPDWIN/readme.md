![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ff068d6-d1d1-47fe-b720-16ce0b2298c9)


This edition is based on [DNXWIN10 HOME GEN edition](https://github.com/Deen0X/DNXWIN/tree/main/BASE_GEN_EDITION) and get specific customized for the GPD-WIN device

The most important difference is removed Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Due this device is focused to play, and their resources are not high, i decided to remove Antivirus for gain performance.

User still can install an antivirus if prefer.

On this edition i decided to run a part of specific software and driver, on User phase (after user enter the UserName on the installation). This is because if i try to install on Machine phase, windows bring an error on the setup.

During installation, you will see the screen rotate few times. It's normal, you must wait until the setup complete. On last part of the installation there is a final restart of the system, and you finally got to login with your user. Until this, donÂ´t mess with programs on screen, even if they are asking for user interaction (the script will close when necessary)

Specific software for the device:

- Removed Microsoft Defender
- Device Drivers and driver fixes (WIFI fix included)
- Included Custom Resolutions (960x544, 800x448, 640x360). Added icons for 960x544 and 1280x720 to the desktop for quick resolution change.
- Controller Companion & configs for many games (Thanks to Pochowandpoch)
- Overlay Intel. This is the script from [ciphray.bat and Chewk.overlay](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/826965330965430272/832688561277894686)
- Magpie Scaling Software
