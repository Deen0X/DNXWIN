# DNXWIN10 GPD-WIN2 Edition

This edition is based on may DNXWIN10 HOME GEN edition and get specific customized for the GPD-WIN2 device

The most important difference is removed Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Due this device is focused to play, and their resources are not high, i decided to remove Antivirus for gain performance.

User still can install an antivirus if prefer.

Specific software for the device:

- Motion Assistant - Preconfigured Shortcut Keys for most functionallity.
- Handheld Companion - Not all shortcuts are preconfigured. This must need some tweak and bring in future release (or via online update)
- Overlay Intel. This is the script from [ciphray.bat and Chewk.overlay](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/826965330965430272/832688561277894686)
