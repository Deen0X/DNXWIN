This edition is based on [DNXWIN10 HOME GEN edition](https://github.com/Deen0X/DNXWIN/tree/main/BASE_GEN_EDITION) and get specific customized for the GPD-WIN2 device

The most important difference is removed Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Due this device is focused to play, and their resources are not high, i decided to remove Antivirus for gain performance.

User still can install an antivirus if prefer.

Specific software for the device:

- Removed Microsoft Defender
- Device Drivers
- Old Display Panel
- Included Custom Resolutions (960x544, 800x448, 640x360). Added icons for 960x544 and 1280x720 to the desktop for quick resolution change.
- Motion Assistant - Preconfigured Shortcut Keys for most functionallity.
- Handheld Companion - Not all shortcuts are preconfigured. This must need some tweak and bring in future release (or via online update)
- Overlay Intel. This is the script from [ciphray.bat and Chewk.overlay](https://discord.com/channels/243411108940087297/826965330965430272/832688561277894686)
