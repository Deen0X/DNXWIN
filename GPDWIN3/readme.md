This edition is based on DNXWIN10 HOME GEN edition and get specific customized for the GPD-WIN2 device

The most important difference is removed Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Due this device is focused to play, and their resources are not high, i decided to remove Antivirus for gain performance.

User still can install an antivirus if prefer.

Specific software for the device:

- Device Drivers
- Included Custom Resolutions (960x544, 800x448, 640x360). Added icons for 960x544 and 1280x720 to the desktop for quick resolution change.
- Motion Assistant - Preconfigured Shortcut Keys for most functionallity.
- Handheld Companion - Not all shortcuts are preconfigured. This must need some tweak and bring in future release (or via online update)
- Overlay Intel. This is the script from ciphray.bat and Chewk.overlay
- DNXDOScript for tweaks and performance
- Included Extra Software Script

>[!NOTE]
>User need to configure the back buttons of the device, for use the pre-configured key combination of Motion Assistant and/or Handheld Companion
